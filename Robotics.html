    <p>As both robotics and artificial intelligence rapidly grow as their fields, their development and usage present greater challenges to engineers and developers.</p>
    <p>Moral questions about the potiential impact on human lives.<p>
    <p>Moral questions about the capabilities/independence of artificial intelligence <p>
    <p>Some concerns people have include bias in AI, AI opacity, human-robot interaction, automation and employment, autonomous systems, among other privacy and surveillance concerns.</p>

    <p>Robotics and atificial intelligence are two different technologies, however there is a connection between them that allow them to be combined to increase their potential. Artificially intelligent robots are manipulated by different artificial intelligence programs to optimise different tasks.
      In the future scientists believe that most robots will have artificial intelligence features included so this will help them accomplish more achievements and improve their performance.
