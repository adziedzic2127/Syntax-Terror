    <p>As both robotics and artificial intelligence rapidly grow as their fields, their development and usage present greater challenges to engineers and developers.</p>
    <p>Moral questions about the potiential impact on human lives.<p>
    <p>Moral questions about the capabilities/independence of artificial intelligence <p>
    <p>Some concerns people have include bias in AI, AI opacity, human-robot interaction, automation and employment, autonomous systems, among other privacy and surveillance concerns.</p>

    <p>Robots are automated devices/machines that can carry out tasks they are specifically designed for. Robotics and atificial intelligence are two different technologies, however there is a connection between them that allow them to be combined to increase their potential.
      Artificially intelligent robots are manipulated by different artificial intelligence programs to optimise different tasks. Artficial intelligent robots can be used in healthcare, retail, education, and military. Robots intended for close interaction use a higher level 
      of artficial intelligence. Contemporary humanoid robots have limited ability to recognize speech and mimic human emotions and facial expressions. In the future scientists believe that most robots will have artificial intelligence features included so this will help them
     accomplish more achievements and improve their performance. In artificial intelligent robots, the artificial intelligence is the "brain" and the sensors and parts are the "body" because of each of their different functions. Artficial intelligence robots have limited 
     capabilities for now, but by using neural networks these capabilities can be expanded in the future.
