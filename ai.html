  <p>Types of Artificial Intelligence</p>
    <ol>
  <p>Reactive Machines: Is the most basic of AI principles, it is capable of only using its intelligence to perceive and react to the world in front of it. It cannot store a memory and as a result cannot rely on past experiences to inform decision making in real-time. These types of AI are more trustworthy and reliable.</p>
  <p>Limited Memory: Has the ability to store previous data and predictions when gathering information and weighing potential decisions essentially looking into the past for clues on what may come next. These types are more complex and presents greater possibilities than reactive machines.</p>
  <p>Theory of Mind: This type is more theoretical and has been the most difficult level to achieve due to technological and scientific capabilities. The concept is based on the psychological premise of understanding that other living things have thoughts and emotions that affect the behavior of oneâ€™s self.</p>
  <p>Self-Awareness:  This is the final step of AI and has not necessarily been reached because we have to establish the theory of mind concept. This kind of artificial intelligence possesses human-level consciousness and understands its own existence in the world, as well as the presence and emotional state of others.  It would be able to understand what others may need based on not just what they communicate to them but how they communicate it.</p>
