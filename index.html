        <strong>What is Artificial Intelligence?</strong>
      </h1>

      <p>Is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with
        building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require
        human intelligence.</p>

      <p><strong>There are 4 types of Artificial Intelligence:</strong>
          <ol>Reactive machines</ol>
          <ol>Limited memory</ol>
          <ol>Theory of Mind</ol>
          <ol>Self-Awareness</ol>
      </p>

      <p>Artificial intelligence development has made incredible strides in the last decade.</p>

        <strong>What is Robotics?</strong>
      </h1>

      <p>The earliest robots as we know them were created in the early
        1950s by George C. Devol, an inventor from Louisville,
        Kentucky. (Computer Science Stanford)</p>

      <p>Robotics has developed so much over the last 70 years.</p>

      <p>Robotics has astonishingly taken off since the concept was first introduced. The development
        of aerial drones has been utilized by the United States military to complete missions.
        Modern day robotics is quite beneficial to society. </p>
